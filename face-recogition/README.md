# Face-recognition

This is a small project about the application of computer vision on face recognition.

## Installation 

I used a library named "face-recognition" as the main library to complete my project. This is built using dlibâ€™s state-of-the-art face recognition
built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the
Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.
